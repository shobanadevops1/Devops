kubectl rollout restart deployment grafana -n <namespace>

one cluster
how appln is going 
how they want to use it (
prometheus can be set uo as master slave , instead of a k8 server with diff namespace ,each namespaces ca allocate a quota so that they cannot over breach 
Appln team wants 
2 ways 
replicate the exisitng system we can have one prometheus --> diff ns -->
one prometheus 
disucssion with carsten :

user approval --> sebastain


process to use prometheus --> req is snow --> configure on own --> prometheus endpoints .

separate cluster --> master / slave 
thie own k8 cluster , same cluster 

more than one 



1.promrtheus is authentocated 
2.concept usage -->based on roles 
how can an appln (own grafana or shared ) is used 
what are the roles they get , how do they get it , responsibility ,(how they order , where they supposed to run eithr in own or cluster)
role defied to developers .

concept 
multi cluster scenario
multi node cluster -->

where dashboards 
1 prometheus 

grafana 
other cluster -->prometheus chk 
prometheus --> master /slave

can different URL prometheus can support
